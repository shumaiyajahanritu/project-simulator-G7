## Project Overview

Many people, especially in rural areas, face difficulties accessing qualified doctors. As a result, they often rely on unsafe self-medication. Medi-Team Assist solves this by:

* Allowing users to input symptoms.
* Matching symptoms with a database of doctor-verified prescriptions.
* Routing unmatched cases to doctors for real-time consultation.
* Providing 24/7 availability for patients.
* Supporting digital payments with fair revenue distribution.

## Features

* Symptom-based input system.
* Doctor-guided prescription management.
* Real-time online consultation (chat, audio, video).
* Secure patient-doctor data handling.
* Integrated digital payment system.
* Medical history & notification management.

## Process Model

This project follows the Extreme Programming (XP) model for development.
XP was selected because it emphasizes:

* Continuous feedback
* Pair programming
* Test-driven development (TDD)
* Rapid releases and customer involvement

Compared to models like Waterfall or V-Model, XP supports iterative growth, which is vital for a healthcare solution where correct implimentation and fast adaptability are critical.
